I am a full-stack software developer and experienced team leader skilled at actualizing projects and collaborating with others to produce results.

Currently working as a Consultant, Software Engineer for Slalom. Previously full stack software engineer at Oscar Health from Feb 2021 to April 2022.

I self taught myself coding, expanded my teaching to teaching kids coding, then got work as a full stack software engineer.
