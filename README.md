I am a full-stack software developer and experienced team leader skilled at actualizing projects and collaborating with others to produce results.

I self taught myself C++ and JavaScript. I expanded my teaching to teaching kids JavaScript which served to deepen my interest. Balancing an active career (GMAT, LSAT, GRE, SAT, ACT, Math and Physics to adults and teenagers while at the same time creating art in theatre, media, and writing) with developing my skills as a programmer was a unique challenge, and in 2020 I put all of my focus on my engineering skills.

Proficient with JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Redux, React, React-Redux, and familiar with Ruby, C++, and other languages and frameworks, I'm looking solidify an engineering team for a dynamic and world-changing company and eventually lead a team of skilled, diverse engineers. I am committed to diversity, inclusion, and supporting women and LGBTQIA+ people in the tech world.
